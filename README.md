## Objective

Create a standalone java application which allows users to manage their favourite recipes. It should
allow adding, updating, removing and fetching recipes. Additionally users should be able to filter
available recipes based on one or more of the following criteria:
1. Whether or not the dish is vegetarian
2. The number of servings
3. Specific ingredients (either include or exclude)
4. Text search within the instructions.


For example, the API should be able to handle the following search requests:
1. All vegetarian recipes
2. Recipes that can serve 4 persons and have “potatoes” as an ingredient
3. Recipes without “salmon” as an ingredient that has “oven” in the instructions.

## Requirements
Please ensure that we have some documentation about the architectural choices and also how to
run the application. The project is expected to be delivered as a GitHub (or any other public git
hosting) repository URL.

All these requirements needs to be satisfied:

1. It must be a REST application implemented using Java (use a framework of your choice)
2. Your code should be production-ready.
3. REST API must be documented
4. Data must be persisted in a database
5. Unit tests must be present
6. Integration tests must be present

-----------------------------------------

## Setup guide

#### Minimum Requirements

- Java 11
- Maven 3.x

#### Install the application

1. Make sure you have [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk13-downloads-5672538.html) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) installed

2. Open the command line in the source code folder

3. Build project

  ```
  $ mvn package
  ```

Run the tests
  ```
  $ mvn test
  ```


Run the project

  ```
  $ java -jar recipe-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  ```

4. Open the swagger-ui with the link below

http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui.html#/
```

## My solution
I've tried to make it as much production ready as i could.
For instance i've added custom error handling mechanisms, lots of validations on top of 
request objects on real life validations where user might enter unwanted character in the name of the ingredient, very long name, or he might enter numberOfServing of non-positive number etc.
I didn't put restrictions for user to put the same name for ingredient or the recipe because for example recipe named "pasta" might be cooked with different ingredient, but it's still a pasta

I've decided to use simple relational db called H2 and made the relations between ingredients and recipes as many-to-many relationship, since many ingredients might be used in many recipes. 
Finally, I've tried to cover as much as test cases I could I have 48 unit and integration tests, I might have added more, but I needed to finish the task for today
